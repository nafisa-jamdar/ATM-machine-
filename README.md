# ATM MACHINE SIMULATOR
In the ATM Machine project, I utilized my Java programming skills to develop a functional banking system that supports deposits, withdrawals, balance inquiries, fund transfers, and account management.  

Implementation:
The system is structured into key classes:  
- AdminOperation.java: Manages account creation, updates, and deletions.  
- AtmOperation.java: Handles user transactions like withdrawals, deposits, and PIN changes.  
- Main.java: Controls the overall application flow.  

Key Features: 
- User Authentication:Secure login via account number and PIN.  
- Transactions: Supports deposits, withdrawals, and fund transfers with balance validation.  
- Transaction History:Allows users to review past activities.  

Challenges & Solutions:
- I implemented input validation and error handling to manage invalid user inputs efficiently. To maintain data consistency, I synchronized critical code sections.  

Outcome:
- The project successfully simulates core ATM functionalities, improving my Java proficiency and deepening my understanding of software design and user interaction.
